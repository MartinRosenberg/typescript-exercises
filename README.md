# TypeScript Exercises

[Scala](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) solutions to various coding
exercises, organized into packages by origin. Some may have been specifically
intended to be solved using TypeScript, but most will be language-agnostic.

Every exercise is tested using [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and all
examples provided are used as test cases.

> Though I would have preferred [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) +
> [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai), or
> [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine), because Jest is specialized for
> React, everyone else seems stuck on Jest, and I'd rather not have to mess with
> their tests when I copy them in.
