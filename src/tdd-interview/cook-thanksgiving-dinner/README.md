# Cook Thanksgiving Dinner

Accept a single parameter with a variety of actions on it and call those actions
in the correct order: `preheatOven` first; then when that's done, both
`cookTurkey` and `cookDressing` can be done simultaneously; and then when both
of those are done, `serveDinner` can be called. (Beware of burning things by
leaving them in the oven too long!)
