# Check Permutation

Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other.

After you have a "brute-force" solution, attempt to solve this problem in O(n)
-- linear -- time.

A string is a permutation of another if it has the same characters in a
rearranged order.

When dealing with strings, it is wise to seek clarification on case-sensitivity,
whitespace, and character encoding. For this problem, assume case-sensitivity,
count whitespace, and assume a UTF-8 encoding.

For example, inputs "dog" and "god" should return true, while "God" and "dog"
should return false; "dog " and "god" should also return false.
