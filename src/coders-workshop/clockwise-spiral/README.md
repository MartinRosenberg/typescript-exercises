# Clockwise Spiral

Given an _N_ by _M_ matrix, return (or print) the result of traversing the array
in a clockwise spiral from _(0, 0)_.

## Bonus

Implement the above challenge by creating a class with the following methods:

-   `next()`: returns the next element in the clockwise spiral
-   `has_next()`: returns a boolean indicating whether there are further
    elements to display in the multidimensional array
