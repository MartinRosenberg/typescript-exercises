# Capitalize a Title

Write a function that takes a string and properly capitalizes it as if it were
the title of a work of art.

**Your function should not use any built-in capitalization functions (e.g.
`toUpperCase()`).**

The first word should begin with an uppercase, and each subsequent word should
begin with an uppercase except the words `the`, `and`, `of`, and `for`.

For example, an input `"war and peace"` should return `"War and Peace"` and
`"the old man and the sea"` should return `"The Old Man and the Sea"`.
